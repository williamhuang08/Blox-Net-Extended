    Steps to follow:
    1. Figure out which blocks are aligned --> circular and rectangular edges/faces
    2. Jiggle ONLY UNSTABLE blocks with monte carlo, but blocks that are aligned should be jiggled together
        Unstable construction gets a 0 (collision or falling over), stable gets a 1
        If jiggling doesn't lead to convergence, try a larger range for monte carlo and go again
    3. Find the average of all the stable points
        Look for a point that has a stable radius of 3mm --> no point in a 3mm circle around it is unstable (ideally)
